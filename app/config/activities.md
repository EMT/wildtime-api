A grass trumpet is quick to make and fun to blow. All you need is a good blade of grass. Choose carefully and get whistling!

Put your thumbs together, and hold the blade of grass between them, gripping the grass with the top and bottom of your thumbs. Blow into the crack between your thumbs, so the air flows over the grass. You should hear a whistling sound. If you don't hear anything, move the blade of grass a little, and try again. Try making the grass tight or loose, try different blades of grass. Experiment and you'll soon get the hang of it.

For this game you will need a magnifying glass. Head outside, find a fallen tree, patch of grass or turn over a stone. Get down on your hands and knees and focus on the subject with the magnifying glass. Move very slowly, pretend you are a tiny creature, making its way through the habitat. Do things look different at this scale? What do you notice that you don't normally see? Can you draw what you see?


### Animal Charades
Image URL: http://61b3eb0d8e96f445e866-9f74caa3d4552b4d51a2bbe93ea28b6f.r99.cf2.rackcdn.com/animal-charades.svg

This game is best played outside but you can play indoors if its raining. One person pretends to be an animal and the others try to guess who they are. There are many things you can do to give them hints: make creature sounds, walk or run like the animal, act brave or timid, noisy or quiet depending on what you are.

Pretend so well that you become the animal. Give everyone in the group a chance to pretend at least one time, then start again.


### Camouflage Experiments

Nature is an expert at camouflage. For example polar bears are white to blend in with the ice and snow. Stick insects are thin and spindly to look like pieces of tree.

Head outside into a park or garden and see if you can find examples of camouflage. Try to imitate nature by camouflaging yourself. How could you dress to camouflage yourself in different places, or at different times of year? Play hide and seek with a friend. See how well you can camouflage yourselves.

Next time it is raining don't stay inside, put on a raincoat and wellies and experience a natural shower!

Once you're outside splashing through the rain, sniff the air. What does rain smell like? Look around. See if you can spot any animals or insects that you don't normally see when the sun is out. Look at the trees, how do they handle the rain? Some leaves are made so that the rain glides off them. What else you can discover around your home that looks different in the rain than when the sun is out?

Head outside with a friend, take a pencil and paper with you. Try to find somewhere with interesting plants, rocks or trees. Find a place to sit and choose a natural item to describe. Write about it for 5 mins. What does it look like? What colour is it? How big is it? What textures does it have? Be careful not to name the item. When you are finished exchange pieces of paper. Can you tell what it was your friend was describing? Choose a different object and start again.


### Daisy Chain

For this summer activity you will need to head somewhere with lots of daisies, a park or lawn. Maybe you have them in your garden?

Pick daisies with short but thick stems, this will make your chain stronger. Healthy fully open ones make the best necklaces.

Make a small incision at the base of the stem with your thumb nail. Be careful not to go all the way to the bottom. The slit should be just a bit longer than the width of the daisy stem.

Thread the stem of another daisy through the slit. Then repeat the process with subsequent daisies. When you think your daisy chain is long enough, thread the stem of the last daisy through a small slit at the top of the first stem.

Head outside. Can you find a rock to look underneath? When you find one, turn it over carefully. You don't want to harm the things that live under it. What can you see underneath? Are there mini-beasts living there? What patterns can you find in the dirt? Are there slippery slug trails or worm holes?

Observe, snap, draw.

Don't forget to replace the rock carefully when you are done. Try different rocks in different places. What different things can you find? Try at different times of day or in different weather. Record the differences you find in the under-rock world.

Stage a snail race! First, carefully collect some snails. Snails are most active at night or in damp conditions. See if you can collect some after a shower of rain. To make a snail racecourse, draw a circle on the ground about 30 cm in diameter with a smaller circle at the centre, or download the printable course below. Before starting the race give each snail a name. Which one do you think will win? Place the snails in the centre of the circle and start the timer. The first one to get out of the circle wins! Who's the champion?  In what time did they finish? Reward the snails with a nice juicy lettuce leaf before letting them go!

Try racing different creatures – ladybirds, slugs, woodlice, worms or ants. Which creatures are the best athletes?

Take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dF9wgw0gxU&amp;feature=player_embedded">video guide to snail racing</a> from the National Trust's list of 50 things to do before you're 11 ¾.

Challenge your friends to see how far you can explore a wood or garden without touching the floor.

Choose your starting point carefully. Look out for:

- Tree stumps to tiptoe across.
- Logs to balance on.
- Strong branches to swing from.
- Tree roots to balance on.
- Patches of ground to leap over.

Spring is the time for many birds to build a nest, ready for laying their eggs and bringing up their hatched chicks. Can you build a nest that could hold a clutch of eggs and withstand the wind?

Look for materials on the floor that you could use – for example dried grasses, twigs, sticks, and lichen. Now find a low fork in a tree and build your nest.

If you want to give yourself an extra challenge, try using just one hand – the bird only has its beak after all! If there are two of you, you could use one hand each and work together. When you have finished, look for several small stones, cones or other objects that could be your eggs. Place them in your nest. Will it hold them? Then, with your eggs still in the nest, give the branch a little shake to see if your nest would stand up to the wind Take pics of your nest and share with your friends.

Pick them up, crush them or break them between your fingers and smell. Add any smells you like to your pot to make a nature scent. Use a stick to mash them together. Which animals may be attracted to your woodland scent? A bumble bee? A badger? A blackbird?

Bark rubbings are a simple way to collect interesting patterns. This is an activity for a dry day. You will need a large crayon and some thin paper.

Head outside and find a tree. Pick one that feels good to you. Press a sheet of thin paper up against the tree bark and gently rub the side of the crayon on the paper until the pattern of the bark shows. Try it with different trees, which ones make the best rubbings? Afterwards, can you tell which rubbing is from which tree? Collect your rubbings in a bark book. You could include some facts about the tree.


### Leaf Rubbing

Leaf rubbings are a simple way to collect interesting patterns. You will need a large crayon, some thin paper and a hard surface.

Head outside and collect a bunch of interesting leaves. Lay them on your hard flat surface and cover them with a thin sheet of paper. Rub the paper with the side of the crayon until an image of the leaf emerges. Try arranging different leaves together to make a pattern or picture. Do you know what trees the leaves came from?


### Pick Wild Blackberries

Walk to a park or some wild space, find a comfortable looking spot and sit or lie down – maybe under a tree.

Put on a blindfold (you could tie socks together, or a tea towel will do). Listen, feel, and smell the wild (not the socks).


### Moon Walk

Find an out-of-the-way place to build a fairy house, such as at the base of a tree or in a corner of the garden. Then search for things to build and furnish the house. Sticks can become fairy brooms, flowers fairy hats, feathers can be fairy fans. Use your imagination to find fairy uses for all the items that you come across. Take a picture of your fairy house and share with your friends.

This is a fun and interesting way to explore the nature around you. With a friend head somewhere safe with some interesting places and plants to explore. Take it in turns to be blindfolded, with the sighted person leading the blindfolded one to different interesting places. The blindfolded friend has to touch, listen or smell, depending on what's there to explore. Get them to describe their experience. See if your friend can tell when they move from the sunny spots to the shade, or from grass to soil. When you have explored the area, see if they can retrace their steps from the things they experienced.

Collect some cardboard boxes. Fix them together to make a tray big enough to walk in or place smaller boxes close together like stepping stones. Collect as many different natural textures from your garden or the park as you can find. Try leaves, twigs, soil &amp; grass. Fill up your boxes with your finds. Put something different in each box to make them unique.

Guide a blindfolded friend along the walk. Can they guess all the different textures?

Parkour is the art of free-running and finding ways over, under and around obstacles without stopping.

It is usually done in towns and cities but some free-runners are discovering that woods and parks are also great places to do parkour.

Woods are full of natural obstacles such as trees, fallen branches, stumps and mounds of earth. The ground is also much softer than concrete – perfect for the beginner!

Keeping a Wild Journal is a great way to capture the details of your wild adventures. Use the journal to describe the weather and what you can see around you and what you can smell and hear. Draw pictures of plants and animals you see or accounts of activities you do. Note down the changes outside in different seasons. Many of the great plant and animal experts started by keeping journals.


### Mini-Beast City

Find a good place where a variety of insects might like to live. Remember not all live in dark damp places. Some prefer bright sunny spots. Build a mini-beast city using things you find on the floor or around the house. Make them somewhere they can hide from predators, somewhere they can bask in the sun to warm up and get moving and somewhere they can find food. Why not give them a mini-beast playground too.

Next time you visit you may find some mini-beasts have moved in!

Squirrels and jays are just two animals that store food ready for the winter. They need to have a good memory to find them again! Could you survive as a squirrel?

Collect 5-10 acorns, nuts or seeds. If you can't find any, use something else like marbles or stones instead. Find a good place to store or bury them. Go off for a walk, then come back and see if you can find them. Why not really test yourself and store the acorns on one visit to the woodland or park, then look for them the next time you come. Squirrels may have found them, though…

### Sketch A Plant
Image URL: http://61b3eb0d8e96f445e866-9f74caa3d4552b4d51a2bbe93ea28b6f.r99.cf2.rackcdn.com/sketch-a-plant.svg

Take a short walk around your garden or a nearby nature place. Keep your eyes open for a plant or flower that catches your attention. It doesn't matter what it is. Find one that feels good to you, then you know that you have the right one!

When you find your plant or flower, sit down next to it. Don't draw right away. Get to know your plant first. Look at where it is growing. Is it in a sunny spot or shady? Is it alone or with other plants? Is it tall or short? Does it make you feel good to sit with it?

Now you can sketch. Don't worry about making it perfect. Focus on a few things. Look at the leaves. What is their shape? What colour are they? Are the edges smooth or toothed? How about the stem? Is it thick or thin? Round or angular? Hairy or smooth? What colour is it? Don't forget the flowers. How many petals do they have? What colour are they? What is their shape?

Share your plant pictures with your friends, or draw many plants and make a plant art gallery.

You need to do this in the evening as it begins to get dark. Just as the sun starts to set, find a comfortable spot to sit. Sit and be quiet, watch how the colours around you change as it gets darker and darker. Which ones can you see for the longest time? Which ones fade quickly? Can you see shades of grey and black? Are there things you can see at night that you couldn't see during the day? What animals do you think can see best at night?


### Mud Volcano
Image URL: http://61b3eb0d8e96f445e866-9f74caa3d4552b4d51a2bbe93ea28b6f.r99.cf2.rackcdn.com/mud-volcano.svg

Volcanos are one of natures greatest and most powerful forces! You can recreate a mini volcanic eruption in your own garden. You need a good place with plenty of earth to do this as well as baking soda and vinegar. When you have found a suitable spot build a mound about 20-30cm high. Then use a stick or other tool to dig a hole in the centre. Put two tablespoons of baking soda in the hole. Slowly pour in vinegar and watch your volcano erupt…


### Mud Castles

Everyone has heard of Sandcastles, but you don't need to go to the beach to make mud castles. Create your own mud superstructure. It could be in an empty bit of flowerbed, or even a empty flowerpot. Find something to use to dig and shape. It could be an old spoon or yogurt pot. Get creating. Dig a moat, build a wall, shape a mountain. Take pictures of your creation, share and start again.


### Butterfly Feeder
Image URL: http://61b3eb0d8e96f445e866-9f74caa3d4552b4d51a2bbe93ea28b6f.r99.cf2.rackcdn.com/butterfly-feeder.svg

This is a great activity for a summer's day, when there are butterflies around. You will need a piece of string, a paper plate and some mushy fruit.

Make four holes around the rim of your plate. Try to make them evenly spaced. Tie a piece of string through each hole, then tie the ends of the string together so that the plate looks like an upside down parachute. Place mushy pieces of fruit in the plate (butterflies love mushy banana). Hang the feeder near some flowers and wait for visitors. Try to name the different butterflies you see. Can you draw the patterns on their backs?

You can identify <a href="http://www.britishbutterflies.co.uk/identification.asp">British butterflies here</a> on Steven Cheshire's amazing website.

Conkers are the seeds of the horse chestnut tree and can normally be found in winter. To play you need conkers, some string and a screwdriver. Make a hole in your conker with a screwdriver. Thread the string through and tie a knot in the end. Then take it in turns to hit each other's conkers. The winning conker is the last to explode…

Explore a small area of woodland or a park, looking for several secret places. You might find a special smell, colour or an animal's home. Now collect some fallen sticks and mark out a trail to these special places. If you are in a group you can split in two and set a trail for each other. Other visitors to the woodland will probably follow your trail too.


### Worm Charming

Worm charming is a brilliant way to get up and close to these wiggly creatures and lean all about them.

Find a patch of grass or earth, it could be in your garden, local park or woods. Worms are charmed to the surface by sending vibrations into the ground. They probably think a mole is digging a tunnel nearby so they head to the surface to escape being eaten… Try different methods, like putting a garden fork into the ground and hitting it. Patting the ground with your hands or banging a drum on the surface can also work.

Keep all the worms you charm in a safe place, count them, measure them and count their segments before letting them go. Release them somewhere dark and damp, like safely under some bushes so they don't become instant bird food.

Try worm charming in different areas. Which is home to the most worms? You could hold a worm charming competition &amp; see who can charm the most worms.

What could you create for an animal using just fallen leaves and twigs?

- A sleeping bag for a millipede?
- A boat for a wood mouse?
- An umbrella for an owl?

You can create many things by stitching leaves together. Here's how to do it.

Find yourself some fallen leaves and thin but strong fallen twigs. Overlap the leaves and use your thumbnails to carefully make a hole through both layers. Now make a second hole near the first. Push your thin twig down through the first hole and up through the second. Your leaves are now stitched together!

Owls have fantastic vision and can spot their prey in the woods at night. This game helps you to develop your owl-vision. Find several small pieces of cloth of different colours. Find a trail in the woods or your local park or use an area in or around your home. This activity will work anywhere.

One person will place the pieces of cloth along the trail. Put them where they can be seen, but not too easily. Then the rest of the group, one at a time, walk down the trail and see how many pieces they can find. Do this without moving your head from side to side. Look straight ahead and try to catch the colours with the corners of your eyes. This is called using your peripheral vision. Owls are great at this and you can be too!

To make it more interesting, try different coloured pieces of cloth and put them in new places. Make some easy to see and some hard. It doesn't matter how many you actually find. What is important is to practice using your owl-vision in a new way.


### Make A Mini-Beast Watering Hole
Image URL: http://61b3eb0d8e96f445e866-9f74caa3d4552b4d51a2bbe93ea28b6f.r99.cf2.rackcdn.com/make-a-mini-beast-watering-hole.svg

Some mini-beasts – insects like bees and butterflies – will visit a backyard watering dish. This simple insect watering hole requires only a few materials, and makes a great summer project. Can you create the perfect cafe for passing bugs? Here is how to do it. You will need a shallow tray or saucer and some small stones or pebbles.

Place the shallow tray or saucer on the ground. If you choose a spot close to flowering plants, bees and butterflies will find it faster. Fill the tray with smooth, flat stones and pour water into the tray until it fills the spaces between the stones. Be careful that the water does not cover the stones completely. Watch for insects visiting your watering hole for a sip of water on hot days. Document your visitors, try to draw or photograph them!

Tips:

Butterflies need minerals, and drink water from muddy puddles to get these minerals from the soil. You can put a layer of soil in your saucer first, and then add rocks and water to create a puddle of minerals for the butterflies in your garden.

Make sure you refill the tray on hot days when the water may evaporate quickly.


### Snail Farm

Snails can make fun pets for a few days. This a great way to get to know some shell-wearing friends. For this activity you will need a plastic bottle, some damp soil and some fresh snail food like lettuce and weeds.

Cut a small door in the side of the bottle about three inches by two inches so that when the bottle is on its side the door is at the top. Next, place damp soil in the bottle. Go outside and look for snails. Look around leafy plants, in the vegetable garden, or at the base of brick walls. Put them in your snail farm and give them fresh food like lettuce and weeds. Seal the bottle top and the door at the top with some clear tape and punch holes in the tape for air vents. Watch your snails for a few days. What is their favourite food? Can you draw them? Don't forget to let them go!


### Sprout Your Socks

Do you know somewhere where wild grass grows? Do you have some old odd socks? Put one on over your shoes and stomp around in the long grass. Get the sock as dirty as you can. You could hike around your garden or park. When your sock looks really dirty put it in a clear plastic bag with a squirt of water. Tape the bag on a window in a sunny place and check daily to see the sock slowly sprout to life!

Head to your garden, the park, or even better to the beach or woods. Hunt for a special rock. What makes it so special? Is it an unusual shape? Is it shiny and smooth or jagged and rough? Take the rock home and use poster paints to decorate your rock. Maybe it looks like an animal? You can paint it like one and make a rock pet.

Take a picture, share it with your friends, start a rock zoo or farm!


### Pond Dipping
Image URL: http://61b3eb0d8e96f445e866-9f74caa3d4552b4d51a2bbe93ea28b6f.r99.cf2.rackcdn.com/pond-dipping.svg

If you have half a day, go to a local pond. You will need a net and some buckets or containers. Half-fill the containers with water before you start.

Stand at the edge of the pond, sideways on with feet shoulder width apart. This should help you to stay balanced and not fall in. Sweep your net three times in a figure of 8 motion. Turn your net inside out into your container, and investigate your finds. Sketch your discoveries.

Explore different parts of the pond – on the surface, in the weeds, in the mud. Don't forget to look in the air above the pond for insects and birds too. Are different areas home to different types of wildlife? Don't forget to set your finds free when you have finished documenting them!

Before clocks, watches and phones, we had sundials to tell the time. You can make a sundial too. You will need a stick, 12 rocks, some paint or a marker and a watch or clock. Number the rocks 1 to 12. Paint them different colours if you like. Find a sunny spot somewhere that you can return to throughout the day. Place the stick in the ground so that it stands upright. Throughout the day watch your clock. Each hour, look where the sticks shadow is. Place the rock that matches the time so that it is in the sticks shadow. Tomorrow you won't need your watch anymore!


### Grow A Sunflower

Sunflowers grow incredibly fast and get very tall. It is best to plant them in the spring. Try this with your friends and see who can grow the tallest sunflower giant.

You will need a plastic cup, compost, sunflower seeds, and a large flowerpot or garden. Put some damp soil in a plastic cup so it comes up almost to the top. Then poke your finger into the soil to make a hole for your sunflower seed. Drop the seed in the hole. Cover it with some soil and add a little water. Place the cup on a sunny windowsill. You could plant a few if you like, to see which grows best. Make sure that the soil stays damp. After two weeks the sunflower should appear. Now you can measure how much it grows each week. When the plants get too big for cups, transfer to a larger pot or to your garden. After 8 weeks your plant should flower. How tall did it grow?
